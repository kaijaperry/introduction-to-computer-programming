<h1>Dolphins</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#FFF;">
    <p>Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of <b>aquatic mammals</b>.
      They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises,
      so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant
      families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins),
      Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins),
      and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant
      species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade
      Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates. Cetaceans' closest living relatives
      are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.
    <br><br>Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5.6 ft) long and 50 kg (110 lb)
    Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft) and 10 t (11 short tons) killer whale. Several
    species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than females.
    They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers.
    Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can travel at 55.5 km/h (34.5 mph).
     Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey.
     They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and
     is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species
     are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber,
     under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.</p>
    <p>Although dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the
       tropic zones, but some, like the right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates.
       Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale,
       feed on large mammals, like seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple
       females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are
       typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility
       for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively
       long period of time. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form
       of clicks and whistles.</p>
    <p>A group of dolphins is called a "school" or a "pod". Male dolphins are called
      "bulls", females "cows" and young dolphins are called "calves".</p>

    Dolphins are sometimes hunted in places like Japan, in an activity known as
    dolphin drive hunting. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch,
    habitat loss, and marine pollution. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures
     worldwide. Dolphins occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the film
     series Free Willy. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform
     tricks. The most common dolphin species kept is the bottlenose dolphin, while
     there are around 60 captive killer whales.</p>
    <p>The name is originally from Greek <b>δελφίς</b> (delphís), "dolphin", which was
      related to the Greek δελφύς (delphus), "womb". The animal's name can therefore
      be interpreted as meaning "a 'fish' with a womb". The name was transmitted via
      the Latin delphinus (the romanization of the later Greek δελφῖνος – delphinos),
      which in Medieval Latin became dolfinus and in Old French daulphin, which reintroduced
      the ph into the word. The term mereswine (that is, "sea pig") has also historically
      been used.</p>
    <p> The term 'dolphin' can be used to refer to, under the parvorder Odontoceti, all
      the species in the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) and the river dolphin families
      Iniidae (South American river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (La Plata dolphin), Lipotidae
      (Yangtze river dolphin) and Platanistidae (Ganges river dolphin and Indus river dolphin).
      This term has often been misused in the US, mainly in the fishing industry, where all
      small cetaceans (dolphins and porpoises) are considered porpoises, while the fish dorado
      is called dolphin fish. In common usage the term 'whale' is used only for the larger
      cetacean species, while the smaller ones with a beaked or longer nose are considered
      'dolphins'. The name 'dolphin' is used casually as a synonym for bottlenose dolphin,
      the most common and familiar species of dolphin. There are six species of dolphins
      commonly thought of as whales, collectively known as blackfish: the killer whale,
      the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two
      species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae and
      qualify as dolphins. Though the terms 'dolphin' and 'porpoise' are sometimes used
      interchangeably, porpoises are not considered dolphins and have different physical
      features such as a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth; they also differ in their
      behavior. Porpoises belong to the family Phocoenidae and share a common ancestry
      with the Delphinidae.</p>

    There are many interesting facts about dophins. Their orgin, their characteristics,
     and all the research that has been done on them. Here are a just a few of the
     things we know.
    <ul>
      <li> Dolphins are odontocete cetaceans.
        <ol>
          <br>
          <li>The order Cetacea includes a group of mammals fully adapted to life in
            the ocean.
              <br>
              <br>
            <li> The suborder Odontoceti includes those with teeth.
        </ol>
          <br>
        <li> The closest relatives of dolphins are whales and porpoises.
          All are members of the order Cetacea.
          <br>
          <br>
        <li> They do not have hair on the skin. Only a small accumulation
          of thin hair near the spiracle and in some other places. Only the Boto,
           Amazon River Dolphin, has a small amount of hair that they keep as an adult.
